This is a usb version of the readevents program, generating a stream of
consolidated timestamp events from a timestamp card. This program is the
interface to a timestamp card, cleans up some bitorder issues and allows to
add detector time skews and/or a correction to a system time of the host 
PC. The description of the functionality is contained in the main code file,
readevents3.c

Files contained in this directory:

readevents3.c      main code for timestamp card reader
timetag_io2.c	   functions close to the hardware 
timetag_io2.h      header definition for main program
usbtimetagio.h     definitions of commands used both for ioctls() to the
                   device driver and to the firmware in the USB timestamp card
makefile	   

Other files and information necessary to understand this better:

1. Circuit diagram, functional description of the timestamp card

2. Firmware of the USB interface, based on a Cypress FX2 chip. Code in
   directory sdcc/test3, program tp_7.c and friends. Needs serious cleanup.

3. USB device driver for the timestamp card, in usbtimetagdriver directory


First version 17.12.06
consolidated 25.2.08
repaired usb flush option in common version 24.7.08
